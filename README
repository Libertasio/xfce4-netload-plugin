XFce4 Netload plugin
--------------------


Works only on Linux and FreeBSD. The panel plugin is based on the sample-plugin
from Benedikt Meurer and on the xfce4-systemload-plugin from Riccardo
Persichetti.  The layout is the same as the systemload-plugin. This made
programming very easy and looks good, too.

The code for getting the netload is based on IceWM from Marko Macek. If you
have code for other operating systems than Linux or FreeBSD please mail to me
and if you can mail also Marko Macek (see at http://www.icewm.org) so that he
can include it in IceWM, too, if he wants.

I'm not planning making much improvements in the future so if you want to take
over developement, just drop me a note. I just programmed it because I needed
it but I plan to maintain it so that it's running with the most current stable
release of Xfce.

If you have translations for your language, please mail me. I'll include it
in the distribution!
