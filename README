XFce4 Netload plugin
--------------------


This plugin should work on all operating systems supported by Xfce4. On Linux and FreeBSD the code
for reading the netload is integrated. The code for this is based on IceWM from Marko Macek
(http://www.icewm.org). Other operating systems such as NetBSD, OpenBSD or Sun Solaris are supported
by libgtop2 from the GNOME desktop (but GNOME is not required by this library). This is because I
have no testing machines for all this operating systems and some systems require a Client/Server
model, i.e. there are root permissions needed to get out system load and the Xfce4 panel is not
running suid root. The library made this easier to implement (it's implemented by the library and I
didn't have to do that).

The panel plugin is based on the sample-plugin from Benedikt Meurer and on the
xfce4-systemload-plugin from Riccardo Persichetti. The layout is the same as the systemload-plugin.
This made programming very easy and looks good, too.

I'm not planning making much improvements in the future so if you want to take over developement,
just drop me a note. I just programmed it because I needed it but I plan to maintain it so that it's
running with the most current stable release of Xfce.

If you have translations for your language, please mail me. I'll include it in the distribution!
