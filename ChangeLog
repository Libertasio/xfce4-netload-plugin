    * Added support for other operating systems via libgtop2. Linux and FreeBSD code is still
      implemented without libgtop2 but this may change in future.
    * Changed "bit/s" string to "byte/s" since the value *is* in byte/s. Translators may update
      their translated strings, for the German translation I did this already.
    * Changed license to GNU General Public License since linking to the libgtop2 library
      requires this. (libgtop2 is *not* LGPL)
    * See also i18n changes in po/ChangeLog
    * released 0.1.9 which is a test version for 0.2.0
