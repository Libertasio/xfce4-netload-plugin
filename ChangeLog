    * Implemented configurable update interval.
    * Fixed small bug with operating system specific data initialization.
    * Improved the automatic maximum function.
    * Released 0.2.0pre3 which is the next test version for 0.2.0.

    * Changed all static variables to a structure which is given the function
      as a parameter. This makes more than one instance of the plugin possible.
    * Released 0.2.0pre2 which is the next test version for 0.2.0.

    * Using the last four measures in history so it's easier to read.
    * Automatic maximum now really works.
    * Using kilobytes for displaying.
    * Using thousands separators of the current locale for so that it's easier
      to read. Since this feature is not available on in printf() according the
      ISO C99 standard I implemented this myself. This code may contain bugs.
    * Dropped use of libgtop2 library. New code is based on Wormulon 
      (http://www.raisdorf.net/wormulon/) the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD, NetBSD, Sun Solaris and HP_UX (Hewlett-Packard) are directly 
      supported. *BSD without use of kvm.
    * Maximum is configurable.
    * Released 0.2.0pre1 which is a test version for 0.2.0.

    * Added support for other operating systems via libgtop2. Linux and FreeBSD 
      code is still implemented without libgtop2 but this may change in future.
    * Changed "bit/s" string to "byte/s" since the value *is* in byte/s. 
      Translators may update their translated strings, for the German 
      translation I did this already.
    * Changed license to GNU General Public License since linking to the 
      libgtop2 library requires this. (libgtop2 is *not* LGPL)
    * See also i18n changes in po/ChangeLog
    * released 0.1.9 which is a test version for 0.2.0
